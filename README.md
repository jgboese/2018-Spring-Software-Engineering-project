Mobile app for GJ Arboretum  
This is an app to tour the Lincoln Park Arboretum. As you walk around Lincoln park you will be able to see your location and the trees near you. If you click on the nearby trees the app will display information such as height, fall and spring colors and etcetera. 
Use: Can build and run the apk on your Android machine (Works on Android 4.0 and up)  
Note: Since the app centers around your location, the app doesn't actually do anything if you're not inside Lincoln Park.
